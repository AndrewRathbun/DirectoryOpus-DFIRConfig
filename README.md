## Why Should I Care? Isn't Windows File Explorer Good Enough?

Sure it's good enough, but you don't know what you don't know if you've never used an alternative to File Explorer before, be it Directory Opus or another application. Things Windows File Explorer cannot do that saves an immeasurable amount of time:

1. Flat View 
2. Copy files from multiple folders into the same destination folder with choice to recreate (or ignore) each file's directory structure
3. Queue and stack multiple copy tasks with various unattended options (Have you ever copy something overnight only to find it stalled an hour into it when you wake up the next day?)
